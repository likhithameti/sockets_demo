Notes
=====================================

io variable:
------------

It is an instance of the Socket.IO server.
It manages the overall communication between the server and all connected clients.
It handles events that are broadcasted to all connected clients.

socket variable:
---------------

It represents an individual client connection to the server.
It allows communication between the server and a specific client.
It handles events that are specific to a particular client.

socket.emit:
------------
Used to send an event to the specific socket that initiated the connection (i.e., the client itself).
Example: socket.emit('message', 'This is a message for the current client');

socket.to(room).emit:
---------------------
Used to send an event to all clients in a specific room except for the current socket.
Example: socket.to('roomName').emit('message', 'This is a message for all clients in the room except the sender');

socket.broadcast.emit:
-----------------------
Used to broadcast an event to all connected clients except the current socket.
Similar to socket.to(socket.broadcast).emit.
Example: socket.broadcast.emit('message', 'This is a broadcasted message to all clients except the sender');

Example usage client and server
--------------------------------
socket.on("new_visitor", (user) =>{
        console.log("New visitor", user);
        socket.user = user; // current user information binding
        io.emit("visitors", getAllVisitors());
})

Here in the frontend we emit the new_visitor event which is listened by the backend
    const user = "John Doe";
    socket.emit("new_visitor", user);

Now, in the backend we process things and emit the visitors event. Frontend need to listen to the events
    socket.on("visitors", (visitors) => {
        console.log("List of visitors:", visitors);
    });

io refers to the global Socket.IO server instance. When you emit an event using io.emit(), the event is broadcasted to all connected sockets (clients).
